Contribution:
Kevin: minimax with alpha-beta pruning, mobility heuristic, frontier heuristic, piece heuristic
Sophie: random player, alpha-beta pruning, position heuristic function, final heuristic value


Strategy(s): 
Position heuristic function with alpha-beta prunning minimax to the depth of 5. 
Earlier part of the game: try to make the opponents to place more pieces while taking only the importent position(corner/edge)
Later part of the game: focusing more on taking oppoents pieces and prevent the opponents from making good move.
